## Styleguide

All reusable Components \(for example avatar\) should be done inside the [Nitro-Styleguide](https://github.com/Human-Connection/Nitro-Styleguide) repository.

If you need to change something in the styleguide and want to see the effects on the frontend immediately, then we have you covered. You need to clone the styleguide to the parent directory `../Nitro-Styleguide` and run `yarn && yarn run dev`. After that you run `yarn run dev:styleguide` instead of `yarn run dev` and you will see your changes reflected inside the frontend!
